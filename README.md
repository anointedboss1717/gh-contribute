# gh contribute

being a [gh](https://github.com/cli/cli) extension for finding issues to help with in a GitHub repository.

This extension suggests an issue in a given repository to work on. Suggested issues are:

- labelled `help wanted` or `good first issue`
- not labelled `blocked`
- opened within the past year
- do not have a PR associated with them

either uses the current repository or a repository suppled via `-R` like `gh` itself.
